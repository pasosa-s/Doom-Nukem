### Description

OK, let’s get in higher gear! Following up on Wolf3D, Doom Nukem pushes the limits of Raycasting while adding a Game design dimension. You will create a real game by mixing Doom and Duke Nukem 3D! Many basic functional elements are identical. However, they have not been implemented the same way by the designers of both games. It’s up to you to find what works best for you and which lets you add required features that you wish to see.

### Compile & run

This program can run on Linux only. Compatibility with Mac OS has been abandoned, it might work or might not.

You will need the following packages:
- libsdl2-dev
- libsdl2-image-dev
- libsdl2-mixer-dev
- libsdl2-ttf-dev

Then run make. It will compile our libft, then the program itself.

You can run it with `./doom-nukem`.

If you want to edit a specific map, you can use the `--editor` command: `./doom-nukem --editor maps/level_3`.

Enjoy.
